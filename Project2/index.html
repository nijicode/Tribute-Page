        <h3>Ada Lovelace's Biography</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold" >1815 </span>- Born in London, England </li>
          <li><span class="bold" >1832</span> - When she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. </li>
          <li><span class="bold" >1833</span> - Lovelace first met Charles Babbage through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month, Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine.She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could.</li>
          <li><span class="bold" >1840</span> - The mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her "much help in her mathematical studies" including study of advanced calculus topics including the "numbers of Bernoulli" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine).</li>
          <li><span class="bold" >1843 </span>-  She published edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL. Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In Note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.</li>
          <li><span class="bold" >1843 </span>- Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills. He called her "The Enchantress of Number".</li>
          <li><span class="bold" >1852</span> - Lovelace died at the age of 36 from uterine cancer.</li>
          <li><span class="bold" >1953</span> -  More than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B. V. Bowden's Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines.The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.</li>
